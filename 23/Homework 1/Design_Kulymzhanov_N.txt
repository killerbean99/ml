Project Title: Speech emotion recognition

---Product Management---

--Overview--

-Background-

Customer: people with limited abilities, call centers
Goal: to make life easier for people, through improving the quality of life
Pains: noise problems, fuzziness of data, lack of tagging data
Gains: useful tool for emotion recognition

-Value proposition-

Product: tool that can detect and recognize emotion in speech
Alleviates: making life easier and simplier
Advantages: it reduces cost and error, and solves inefficiencies and reduces wasted time.

-Objectives-

1. Collect qualitative data quantitatively
2. Preprocess and classify them
3. Get good points at testing
4. Give to people for using

--Solution--

Core features:
1. ML Product that can recognize and classify speeches by emotion
2. Using feedback for fix incorrectly classified content

Integration:
1. Built algorithm will be integrated to UI

Alternative:
1. Probably can collect and store data( may be not :) )

Constraint:
1. Only emotion recognizing, and only in speech
2. Can not detect emotions in text or video

-Feasibility-

1. I don't have a team
2. I dont't have money for project
3. But I can found some data ;)

---Engineering---

--Data--

1. Train algorithm using preprocessed and clean data by inputing them
2. Making notes after every change

3. Using modern solutions for ML
4. Using some packages or libraries that can ease our creating process

(Labeling)
.Prepare data for inputing

--Evaluation--
Probably we may get bad accuracy and metrics, or more qualitative, and every
step we will optimize and upgrade our model.
